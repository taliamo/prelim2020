## Poynting Vector (energy flux density)

$\vec{S} \neq 1/\mu_0 \vec{E} \times \vec{B}4$ and total electromagnetic field enegy density is $e_{cursive} = 1/2 (B^2/\mu_0 + \epsilon E^2)$,

s.t. Poynting can be written $-\vec{E} \cdot \vec{J} = \partial e_{cursive}/\partial t + \vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec{S}$

Poynting vector represents the momentum carried away by the electromengatic fields. Density of momentum for EM field: $\vec{P}  = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \vec{S}$ Density for angular momentum: $\vec{\lambda} = \vec{r} \times \vec{P} = \epsilon_0 (\vec{r} \times (\vec{E} \times \vec{B}))$.

# EM wave

$\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2}=\frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2}$  where $v$ is velocity of propagation of the wave.

If we introduce $u_1=x-vt$ and $u_2=x+vt$ then we have 
$\partial/\partial u_1 = ( \frac{\partial}{\partial x } - \frac{1}{v} \frac{\partial}{\partial t})$ and 

$\partial/\partial u_2 = ( \frac{\partial}{\partial x } + \frac{1}{v} \frac{\partial}{\partial t})$

and we can write the wave equation as $\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial u_1 \partial u_2} =0$,

with solutions of the form: $\Psi = \Psi_1(u_1) + \Psi_1(u_2)=\Psi_1(x-vt) + \Psi_1(x+vt)$ (general).

## Sinusoidal waves

$\Psi = A cos[k(x-vt)+\delta]$ which satisfies $\partial ^2 \Psi /\partial x^2 = -A(vk)^2cos[k(x-vt)+\delta] = -(vk)^2 \Psi$.

Therefore $\partial^2 \Psi/\partial x^2 = -k^2 \Psi$ and $\frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial ^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} = -k^2 \Psi$.

$k=2\pi/\lambda$, the wave number. $T=2\pi / kv$ is the period.

So $\Psi(x,v(t+T))=\Psi(x,vt)$. Freq of the wave is inverse period, $\nu = 1/T$ so $\nu=v/\lambda$. Also, $\omega=\nu 2\pi = kv$.

So another wave function form is: $\Psi(x,t) = A \cos(kx-\omega t +\delta)$.

If we say right is positive then right (left) moving waves : $\Psi_{R/L}(x,t) = A\cos [kx \mp \omega t \pm \delta]$.

Since cosine is an even function, inverting k -> -k in the equation makes the wave switch from right to left.

### Complex notation:

Euler: $e^{i\theta} = cos\theta + isin|theta$ so 

$\Psi(x,t) = Ae^{i(kx-\omega t + \delta)}$. Note $\delta$ is some delay or phase, such that the complex amplitude is defined by $\tilde A = A e^{i\delta}$.

## Boundary conditions

A wave must be continuous across the interface (boundaries). 

## Linear combination

Sinusoidal solution of the wave equation can be written decomposed into a linear combination of other sinusoidal waves:

$\tilde \Psi(x,t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \tilde A(k)e^{i(kz-\omega(k) t)}dk$ where $\tilde A(k)$ can be obtained from the Fourier transform.

## Momentum of EM field

From Poynting $\vec{S}/c^2 = \vec{P}=e_{cursive}\hat{k}/c$


## Dispersion in a medium

In general, a medium will be dispersed if the index of refraction depends on the frequency, that is $n=n(\omega)$, i.e. when $c/n = \omega/k$.

Phase velocity and group velocity for the dispersive medium: $v_\phi = \omega/k$, $v_g=d\omega / dk$.

### In a conductor

There is always a finite density of free electrons, which if an E field is applied, will generate a current density $\vec{J}=\rho \vec{v}$, where $\rho$ is electron density. This is dictated usually by Ohm's law $\vec{J}=\sigma \vec{E}$. Maxwell's equations are modified:

and the continuity equation must satisfy $\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec{J} = d \partial \rho/\partial t$, which upon replacing Ohm's law gives $\partial \rho/\partial t = -\sigma \vec{\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = -\sigma \rho/\epsilon}$. Solving for this 1st order differential,

$\rho(t)=e^{-(\sigma/\epsilon)t}\rho(0)$, or the free density of charges will dissipate in the characteristic time $\tau \neq \epsilon/\sigma$ and thus is very short for a good conductor $\tau \ll 1/\omega$ and vice versa. This defines a transient time for the charges to flow to the edge, so we want a solution of Maxwell's equations at time $t \gg \tau$ which is:
