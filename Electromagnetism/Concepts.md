I've broken down topics in electromagnetism by:
1. Maxwell's equations
2.  Static fields and charges
3.  Flux and surfaces
4.   EM waves

The topics that Jon said we should know (Nov 20):





Things to look up: retarded fields (Griffiths, ch 10)
B=$\Delta \times A$, like E,V

# Current law, Voltage law

Sum of currents into any junction = sum going out.
Net voltage drop around any closed loop path must be zero.


## Magnetic field from a current

### Biot-Savart Law

Biot-Savart law can be used to advantage in calculating the magnetic field resulting from an electric current distribution (e.g. fine straight wire, current around a loop).

Current creates B field. $d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0 I d \vec{L} \times \vec{1_r}}{4\pi r^2}$, where $\vec{dL}$ is small length of the conductor carrying current $I$ and $\vec{1_r}$ is a unit vector specifying radial direction of the vector distance r from current to the field point somewhere away.

Scattering? Radiation from a point charge?
