# Gauss Law Griffiths ch2
Define a surface around some charge (say to find E field). Gauss' law helps you get rid of dot products and directional issues (if you define a surface through which flux moves *radially*).

shapes: spherical, cylindrical, plane symmetry (lil box around a flat sheet). The latter two work for close to infinite dimensions
## for E field
$\oint_S \textbf{E} \cdot d\textbf{a} = \int_S |\textbf{E}| da=Q_{enc}/\epsilon_0$

## For gravity
Gravity is conserved force, equivalently has zero curl ( $\nabla \times g=0$)

where g is the gravitational field and G is the universal constant and M is total mass enclosed within surface del V
