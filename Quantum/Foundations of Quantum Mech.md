# Operators
Each measureable parameter is a QM operator because each parameter is a wave with some amplitude (probability distribution).

The Hamiltonian operator is energy, $\hat{H}_{op} \Psi_i=E_i\Psi_i$ where each energy value is an eigenenergy and each $\Psi_i$ is an eigenfunction (exact solutions). In time-dependent systems, $\hat{H}\Psi=i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$.

## x and p

position and momentum operators are unitarily equivalent, related by Fourrier transform (basis change). See 2017 Long #4 a).

# Basis changes

You can change bases by defining an operator like:

# Schroedinger Eq

Predicts the future behaviour of a dynamic system (relates to conservation of energy)...and is a wave function that predicts analytically the probability of an outcome (by distributions).

The Hamiltonian is comprised of kinetic and potential energy, which acts upon the wavegunction $\Psi$ to generate teh evolution of the wavegunction in time and space. Schroedinger eq gives wuantized energy and form of the wavefunction so other quantities can be calculated (Hyper physics).

## Time independent

### Free particle
Has no V or U, potential energy, term

## Time dependent

In 2D, U(x,y) and $(\partial^2/\partial x^2 + \partial^2/\partial y^2)$ 



## Quantum Numbers

spin can be 1/2 or 1 depending on particle type.

# Wavefunctions

The state of a particle is of the form something like $\Psi=Axe^{-distance/position}$ for time-independent. Where there might be boundayr conditions. You can choose these conditions based on, maybe the derivative of this function. You can think of it like the composition of cos/sin functions, where you need the wave function/oscillation to be countinuous at the edges of a box (quantum well).

See how the function is continuous at the edges/boundaries.

# Delta functions

note $\delta(x-a)=0$ for $x\neq a$
