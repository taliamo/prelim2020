## Uncertainty principle

$\delta x \delta p > \hbar/2$
$\delta E \delta t > \hbar/2$
-> energy required to contain a particle within a given volume too 
Forces come from EM force for attraction to contain electrons and strong nuclear force to contain particle in nucleus... Planck's constant determines size of confinement that can be produced by these forces.

## Blackbody Radiation

Aka Cavity radiation: absorbs incoming radiation and re-emits energy at a frequency or of a type only dependent on the blackbody itself, not on the incoming energy.

Mode for an EM wave in a cavity must satisfy the condition of zero electric field at the wall

## Bohr Model

-treats electrons as miniature planets with definite radius and momentum (violated uncertainty principle of not knowing both simultaneously)

-wavelength of electron is given by DeBroglie relationship $\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$

## Photoelectric effect
electrons ejected from conducting surface had energy proportional to frequency of the illuminating light. $E=h\nu$. 

## Fermi Energy

Fermi energy is the difference betwen lowest and highest energy particles at T=0Kelvin (also max E_K an electron can have at T=0 K)
