## Fermi-Dirac
![[Pasted image 20201125120804.png]]

Fermi function: probability that a fermion will occupy a certain energy state E. Up to E_F, at T=0, probability is close to 1. Above E_f, probability goes to 0.

kT is about 10^2 smaller than the order of magnitude of E_f

### Fermi Gas
Can be non-interacting

$d N(E)=\bar n(E) g_s g(E) dE$

and $e_F/k_B=T_F$

## Bose-Einstein
![[Pasted image 20201125120726.png]]

Bose -Einstein condensation: any number of bosons can condense into a cloud (fermions have Pauli exclusion)


## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (classical)
Any number of particles can occupy any energy state (classical)
Distinguishible particles (unlike F-D, B-E) -> non-overlapping wave functions

$f(E)=\frac{1}{Ae^{E/kT}}$ where A is a normalization constant, exponential term is states that probability for occupying a given energy state decreases exponentially with energy and KT is thermal energy: for higher T, more probable that a given particle can be found with energy E
