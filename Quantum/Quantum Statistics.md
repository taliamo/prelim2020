## Bose-Einstein

Bose -Einstein condensation: any number of bosons can condense into a cloud (fermions have Pauli exclusion)


## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution (classical)
Any number of particles can occupy any energy state (classical)
Distinguishible particles (unlike F-D, B-E) -> non-overlapping wave functions

$f(E)=\frac{1}{Ae^{E/kT}}$ where A is a normalization constant, exponential term is states that probability for occupying a given energy state decreases exponentially with energy and KT is thermal energy: for higher T, more probable that a given particle can be found with energy E
