# Carnot cycle

Adiabatic: No net work done on outside world
Isothermal: no net change in T

[Work, change in T, change in S etc](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Map%3A_Principles_of_Modern_Chemistry_(Oxtoby_et_al.)/UNIT_4%3A_EQUILIBRIUM_IN_CHEMICAL_REACTIONS/13%3A_Spontaneous_Processes_and_Thermodynamic_Equilibrium/13.8%3A_Carnot_Cycle_Efficiency_and_Entropy#:~:text=The%20Carnot%20cycle%20is%20the%20most%20efficient%20engine,different%20parts%20of%20the%20engine%20at%20different%20temperatures.)


Work is done to change the volume.  Isothermal processes involve change in entropy, adiabatic processes involve change in T, no change in entropy.

## Efficiency 

Efficiency is net work done by heat engine /heat absorbed by heat engine = -W_sys/Q_high

To get W_sys, you use total work = work from each 4 segments of the process.
